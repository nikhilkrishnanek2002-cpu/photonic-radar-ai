**A next-generation simulation and control platform for Cognitive Photonic Radar systems.**

This project simulates a high-frequency Photonic Radar system (FMCW/Heterodyne) and uses AI to classify targets based on their micro-Doppler signatures. It features a professional "Command Center" dashboard for real-time monitoring and control.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Physics-Based Simulation**:
  - Photonic-generation of RF signals (Laser Phase Noise, Heterodyne Mixing).
  - Realistic FMCW Chirp, Delay, and Doppler modeling.
  - Simulation of **Drones**, **Birds**, **Aircraft**, **Missiles**, and **Clutter**.
  
- **Advanced Signal Processing**:
  - **Range-Doppler Maps** (2D FFT implementation).
  - **Micro-Doppler Spectrograms** (STFT).
  - Accurate CA-CFAR Detection.

- **AI/ML Integration**:
  - Multi-branch CNN Architecture (`RangeDoppler` + `Spectrogram` Fusion).
  - **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Strategic analysis and feature attribution for every detection.
  - Real-time Inference Engine with confidence metrics.

- **Research Benchmarking**:
  - Automated sensitivity curves (Pd vs SNR).
  - Operational reliability analysis (Pfa vs Threshold).
  - AI Robustness and Computational Latency benchmarks.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a clean, modular Layered Architecture:

| Layer | Directory | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Simulation** | `src/simulation/` | Photonic core, target responses, noise models, and scenarios. |
| **DSP** | `src/dsp/` | Signal transforms (2D-FFT, STFT), performance metrics, and evaluation tools. |
| **AI** | `src/ai/` | PyTorch models, Inference pipeline, and XAI modules. |
| **Analytics** | `src/analytics/` | Comparative analysis, benchmarking engine, and failure analysis. |
| **UI** | `src/ui/` | "Design-system" driven UI components and layout logic. |
| **Interfaces** | `src/interfaces/` | Future-proof hooks for SDR, FPGA, and real-world data integration. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Linux/Windows/MacOS

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/PPhotonic_Radar_AI_Project.git
    cd PPhotonic_Radar_AI_Project
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Launch the Dashboard**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    This will open the "Command Center" in your default web browser (usually http://localhost:8501).

2.  **Simulation Mode**:
    - Select **Simulation** in the Sidebar.
    - Use the **Target Manager** to add/remove targets (e.g., set up a "Drone" at 50m with 10m/s velocity).
    - Click **RUN SIMULATION**.
    - Observe the real-time **Range-Doppler Map** and **AI Classification**.

### Verification

To verify the system integrity (useful for CI/CD or initial setup):
```bash
python3 tests/verify_pipeline.py
```

## 🛠️ Future Scope

- **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)**: Integrate with RTL-SDR or SDRplay for real-time RF capture.
- **XAI (Explainable AI)**: Visualize Grad-CAM activation maps on the Range-Doppler input.
- **Tracking**: Implement Kalman Filter for multi-object tracking (MOT).
